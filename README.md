# Peoples River Stories

Community-driven interactive map of American river stories—forked from Queering the Map for “A Secret History of American River People.”

## Setup

You have two options for setting up the project: a quick setup for frontend-only work or a full setup with Supabase.

### Option 1: Quick Setup for Frontend-Only Work

This approach is quicker and allows you to work on the frontend without setting up Supabase. Note that popups will not show text if you choose this option.

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Run the seed script to generate mock data: `npm run seed-data`.
3. Copy `.env.example` into `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`.

### Option 2: Full Setup with Supabase

This approach is necessary if you want to also work on the backend. It takes longer to set up but provides a complete development environment, aligned with what we use in production.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Set up a Supabase (local) project with the [official CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).
1. Set the environment variables.
   1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (manually or with `cp .env.example .env`).
   1. Get your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from the output of `supabase start`.
1. Run the DB migrations locally with `supabase db reset`.
1. Fetch the data from Supabase: `npm run fetch-data`.

## Developing

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

For testing the database make sure that the `pgTap` extension is enabled in postgres ([more info](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgtap)). Afterwards, you can run: `supabase test db`.

## Deploying and Building for production

To use Supabase as a remote backend make sure to link your local development with your remote Supabase project:

1. Make sure you have a Supabase acount and connect it to the supabase cli: `supabase login`
1. Link a specific remote project `supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>` ([more info](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-link))
1. Run migrations on remote DB `supabase db push` ([more info](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-push))
1. Make sure that the env vars `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` do point to the correct production project and not the local containers. You can grab them from inside [your Supabase project's dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Set up Captcha Protection

For Captcha protection of the point submissions, we use Cloudflare Turnstile. Once you create a widget there, populate the correct values for the env variables:

```bash
PUBLIC_CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SECRET
```

For more info, see this guide: https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/.
